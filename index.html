                <h1>Mammoth, CA</h1>
                <p><h3>Hiking in the Eastern Sierra is spectacular year-round. In spring, the sharp and craggy granite peaks of the Sierra Nevada Range form a dramatic backdrop for meadows brightly colored by wildflowers. In the summer, you’ll never tire of finding secret alpine lakes, lush aspen-lined streams and forested hideaways tucked away in the mountains. In fall, early snow in the high country contrasts beautifully with the vibrant golds and oranges of aspens and willows alight with their display of autumn colors. There are plenty of short, easy and family-friendly hikes.</h3></p>

                    <h1>Tumbledown Mountain</h1>
                    <h2>Weld,ME</h2>
                    <p><h3>Tumbledown Mountain is located in western Maine near Weld Village. While not the highest mountain in the region, it is easily the most interesting. The south face of Tumbledown is comprised of impressive 700+ foot cliffs which form the northern side of Byron Notch. While Tumbledown's three open summits are impressive (West, East, and North Peaks), the most outstanding aspect of the mountain is Tumbledown Pond. The Pond is situated at approximately 2,800 feet and is surrounded on three sides by higher elevations. Of Tumbledown's three peaks, North Peak is the highest at 3,090 feet. East Peak and West Peak are only slightly lower.</h3></p>

                    <h1>Angels Landing</h1>
                    <h2>Zion National Park, Utah</h2>
                    <p><h3>Angels Landing in Zion National Park is one of the most spectacular day hikes in the world. The trail to its lofty summit was hewn out of its steep, rock-solid spine in 1926 and it continues to thrill hikers to this day. The hike climbs up roughly 1,500 vertical feet along the narrow fin of stone that reaches a top elevation of 5,790 feet. A chain railing adds an element of safety, but if exposed heights make you weak in the knees, it will take a double-dose of courage to make the summit. This is one adventure that packs a mountain of excitement into a relatively compact, daring hike.</h3></p>

                    <h2>Utah</h2>
                    <p><h3>Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument spans 1.87 million acres of central Utah stretching from the boundary of Bryce Canyon National Park in the west to the boundary of Capitol Reef National Park and Glen Canyon in the east. It stretches all the way to the Utah-Arizona state line to the south. This incredible national monument is home to a mind-boggling array of natural and human history from the staircase-like cliffs in the west to the arid Kaiparowits Plateau to the slot canyons formed by the Escalante River in the east. Throughout this wildly varied landscape rock art and other Native American cultural sites can be found, along with a huge array of dinosaur fossils.</h3></p>

                    <p><h3><center>Katahdin stands alone as the single most challenging peak in the state of Maine. From Maine to Georgia and beyond, Katahdin has been one of the Northeast’s premier hiking destinations ever since the Appalachian Trail was completed in 1937. This loop tackles five notable summits in the heart of Maine’s fabled Baxter State Park. You will pass by cascading brooks, alpine lakes, spectacular panoramic views, and miles of scrambly travel above tree-line. Whether you’re a long-distance backpacker, a peak bagger, or just someone looking for the best hiking that New England has to offer, a trip to Katahdin has adventure written all over it!</center></h3></p>
